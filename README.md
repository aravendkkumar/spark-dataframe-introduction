# Spark DataFrames Introduction

This is an introduction for Apache Spark DataFrames.
You can practically learn Apache Spark DataFrame APIs with the real data sets from Github Archive.

Apache Spark DataFrames are very useful data analytics tool for data scientists.
It allow us to analize data more easily and more fast.

## TODO

I will try to add the introduction for Python and R.
Because Spark provides the APIs for Python and R (via SparkR), we should add the explanations for not only Scala but also Python and R.
